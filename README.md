#### CAN-SPAM (The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act) Requirements
The CAN-SPAM act requires that Commercial emails, whose primary purpose is to deliver commercial content, meet the following criteria:

- Accurately identify the sender in the header information.
- Use a subject line that accurately represents the content of the email.
- Identify the message as an advertisement, unless you have express consent (opt-in) from the subscriber.
- Include your physical mailing address.
- Provide a mechanism to opt out. You cannot require a subscriber to log in or visit more than a single page to unsubscribe.
- Honor opt-out requests within 10 days.
  
#### CAN-SPAM Explanation
The CAN-SPAM act is a law that sets:

- The rules for commercial email
- Establishes requirements for commericial messages
- Gives recipients the right to have you stop emailling them
- Spells out tough penalties for violations
  
#### Transactional Messages
If a customer orders a product from your website, the receipt sent via email is a transactional message. Transactional messages must identify the sender in the header information. 
  
#### Optimize Deliverability of Messages

1. Ensure subscribers have opted in
2. Have a recognizable "From Name" and "Email Address"
3. Manage cadence of messaging and frequency of content (ideally set expectations on this with the subscriber)
4. Purge old or inactive emails
5. Authenticate your email: Domain keys, Sender ID, and SPF Configuration
